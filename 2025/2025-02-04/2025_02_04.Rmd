## Load necessary packages
setwd("/home/pawan/myfiles/tidy-tuesday/2025/2025-02-04/")
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)

## Load the data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-02-04')
## Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
simpsons_characters <- tuesdata$simpsons_characters
simpsons_episodes <- tuesdata$simpsons_episodes
simpsons_locations <- tuesdata$simpsons_locations
simpsons_script_lines <- tuesdata$simpsons_script_lines

## Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

characters <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_characters.csv")
episodes <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_episodes.csv")
locations <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_locations.csv")
scripts <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_script_lines.csv")


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Important!)

## 1. Clean script lines:
names(characters)<-c("id","character_name","character_normalized_name","gender")
names(locations)<-c("id","location_name","location_normalized_name")

scripts[, normalized_text := tolower(gsub("[^[:alnum:] ]", "", raw_text))] ## Lowercase, remove punctuation
scripts <- scripts[!is.na(normalized_text) & normalized_text != ""] ## Remove NAs and empty strings
scripts <- scripts[character_id != 8290] ## Remove "All" character (group speaking)

## 2. Merge data:
setkey(scripts, character_id)
setkey(characters, id)
scripts <- merge(scripts, characters, by.x = "character_id", by.y = "id", all.x = TRUE)

setkey(scripts, episode_id)
setkey(episodes, id)
scripts <- merge(scripts, episodes, by.x = "episode_id", by.y = "id", all.x = TRUE)

setkey(scripts, location_id)
setkey(locations, id)
scripts <- merge(scripts, locations, by.x = "location_id", by.y = "id", all.x = TRUE)


## Analysis

## 1. Character with most spoken lines:
most_lines <- scripts[, .N, by = character_name][order(-N)][1:10] ## Top 10
print("Characters with most spoken lines:")
most_lines

## Dialogue volume change over seasons:
dialogue_by_season <- scripts[, .N, by = .(character_name, season)][order(season, -N)]
ggplot(dialogue_by_season, aes(x = season, y = N, fill = character_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Dialogue Volume by Character and Season", x = "Season", y = "Number of Lines") +
  theme_bw()


## 2. Most frequent locations:
most_frequent_locations <- scripts[, .N, by = location_name][order(-N)][1:10]
print("\nMost frequent locations:")
most_frequent_locations

## Location vs. IMDb rating (requires careful handling of NAs and potential outliers)
location_imdb <- scripts[!is.na(imdb_rating), .(avg_imdb = mean(imdb_rating),
                                                num_episodes = .N), by = location_name]
location_imdb <- location_imdb[num_episodes > 5] ## Filter locations with enough data points (e.g., > 5 episodes)
print("\nLocation vs. IMDb Rating (Locations with at least 5 episodes):")
location_imdb

ggplot(location_imdb, aes(x = location_name, y = avg_imdb)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  ## Horizontal bar chart for readability
  labs(title = "Average IMDb Rating by Location", x = "Location", y = "Average IMDb Rating") +
  theme_bw()


## 3. US Viewers vs. IMDb (Handling NAs is crucial)
viewers_imdb <- episodes[!is.na(imdb_rating) & !is.na(us_viewers_in_millions)]
cor_imdb_viewers <- cor.test(viewers_imdb$us_viewers_in_millions, viewers_imdb$imdb_rating)
print("\nCorrelation between US Viewers and IMDb Rating:")
cor_imdb_viewers

ggplot(viewers_imdb, aes(x = us_viewers_in_millions, y = imdb_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "US Viewers vs. IMDb Rating", x = "US Viewers (Millions)", y = "IMDb Rating") +
  theme_bw()


## 4. Common words/phrases:
word_counts <- scripts[, .N, by = normalized_text][order(-N)][1:20] ## Top 20 words
print("\nMost common words/phrases:")
word_counts


## Word frequencies by character (example with Homer):
homer_words <- scripts[character_name == "Homer Simpson", .N, by = normalized_text][order(-N)][1:10]
print("\nHomer's most frequent words:")
homer_words
